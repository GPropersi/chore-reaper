#!/bin/bash
# gh-app-push.sh — safely push a branch to GPropersi/chore-reaper as c4i-claude-bot[bot].
#
# Why this exists:
#   Claude Code's environment may carry a stale/unrelated GH_TOKEN (e.g. a personal
#   PAT). The conventional one-liner
#       GH_TOKEN=$(token-gen) git ... "https://x-access-token:$GH_TOKEN@..."
#   has a bash evaluation bug: the parent shell expands $GH_TOKEN inside the URL
#   BEFORE the command-prefix assignment takes effect, so git would push with
#   whatever was already in the environment — not the fresh App token. This
#   script sidesteps the issue by storing the fresh token in a local variable
#   named APP_TOKEN (so nothing in the environment can shadow it) and unsetting
#   GH_TOKEN so no subprocess accidentally inherits a stale value.
#
#   The token is also never embedded in the remote URL. Instead it's handed to
# git via GIT_ASKPASS (gh-app-askpass.sh), which reads it from APP_TOKEN. This
#   means the token never appears in anything git prints — push progress lines,
#   the upstream-tracking message, `git remote -v` — which matters because
#   whatever a command prints is visible to whatever ran it (e.g. an agent's
#   tool output), not just to whoever's at the keyboard.
#
# Usage:
#   .claude/scripts/gh-app-push.sh [branch-name]
#
# Arguments:
#   branch-name  Optional. Defaults to the current branch. Must not be
#                main or master. Must not contain any force-push flag.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  Push succeeded.
#   2  Bad arguments (too many, or detached HEAD with no branch given).
#   3  Refused: target is main/master or a force flag was supplied.
#   4  Token generator missing or not executable.
#   5  Token generator returned an invalid value.
#   other  git push failed (its own exit code is propagated).
